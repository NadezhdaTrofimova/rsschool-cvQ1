## About myself

I would like to became a programmer to use my strengths like versatile, active and self-motivated. I have no proffessional programming experience, but I am ready to learn a lot and strive for the best quality. Since 2014 I have been working as a lawyer in commercial firms and I think one of my greatest strengths is as a problem solver.
